# 0x02. ES6 Classes

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It focuses on the concept of ES6 classes in JavaScript.

## Description

In this project, we explore the ES6 class syntax and its usage in JavaScript. We will learn how to define classes, create objects from classes, and use class inheritance to create subclasses. Additionally, we will cover topics such as constructors, methods, static methods, getters, and setters.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `0-square/`: Contains a simple Square class implementation.
- `1-square/`: Builds upon the previous directory and adds more functionality to the Square class.
- `2-square/`: Introduces inheritance by creating a new class Rectangle that inherits from Square.
- `3-square/`: Expands on the previous directory by adding more functionality to the Rectangle class.
- `4-square/`: Implements a new class Square that extends from the previous Rectangle class.
